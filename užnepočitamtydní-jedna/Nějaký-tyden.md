Syntax II
Infinitive still bears nominal features.  It can take all sorts of syntactic features that are normally realized by nouns. It can take the subject function.  However, unlike some other non finite verb forms, infinitive in the subject is rather rare.  Realizes object functions, after transitive verbs.  "They heard the window bang." two interpretations SVO, SVOC.
Subject compliment. "They are to blame."  "The examples appear to be false."

"She came to see us." May be called an infinitive of purpose, but it is better refered to as an infinitive of goal.

"We are so foolish to believe that." Infinitive of adjunct.

Disjunct functions. " To change the subject."
Conjunct functions "To sum up."

"I'm not in a possition to decide the matter." attribute realized by an infinitve.

"I'll be happy to send you the invitation." SVC pattern. (part expressed by the infinitive is active title complimentation.)


Apposition is another possible syntactic function. "Your ambition to become a parent calls for something."

"She came to see us." Finite verb+nonfinite verb counterpart. Two predications, one is the finite verb, the other non finite.  "Shared subject"

The doer(subject) is different: "For him to pay the sum means nothing." The subject is "for him to pay the sum" 

Transformation.
"To interpret the message proved impossible." The verb is follwed by a compliment, and everything before is the subject.

This is an overburdened subject.  "It proved impossible to interpret the message." Is less overburdened. This is an anticipatory 'it'. Semantic subject(real subject, notional subject) "to interpret the message"

"The message proved impossible to interpret." The object of the infinitive is moved to the begining and becomes the subject of the sentence.  This is called "object raising"

"John is easy to please." Vs "John is eager to please."

Anticipatory it doesn't only anticipate the real subject, it can also anticipate the real object: "I will leave it to you." anticipatory it.

"He is likely to succeed." What is likely? Split subject, can be paraphrased as: "His success is likely." But you cannot say "He is likely." To determine that a sentence has a split subject we must use a question test. "What is likely."

"He is cleaver." Paraphrase "it seems that he is cleaver."
