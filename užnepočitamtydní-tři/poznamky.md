Nominal content clause
------
They can act as nouns, syntactically.

Although they are syntactially subordinate, they are semantically significant.  "She said that she was satisfied." "She said" is the matrix clause, and the subordinate clause is "that she was satisfied"  however semantically it is important.

The word content features only in Dušková, in Quirk, Nominal content clauses don't appear, rather  "Nominal clauses" are subcatigorized into two subtypes(nominal content and relative clauses).  Quirk stresses the nominality of both subtypes, Pikalovás aproach is more in line with Dušková.

The destinction between the declarative, interrogative, inderrogative ect is not gramatical.  Since we are discussing clauses and not sentences.

syndetic - with conjunction. asyndetic - without conjunction.
